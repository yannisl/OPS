\section{General}
\normalsize
\newthought{The Podia present a challenge} due to the large area covered, and  co-ordination between disciplines.  By and large, Podia will be completed by \deadline . \sidenote{In addition to these sections substantial final fix activities will have to be completed after the Fit-out Contractor has completed his portion of the works.}

\section{Current Status}

First and second fix MEP  is approximately 75\%--80\% complete. In many areas work is almost ready for ceiling closures. The Podia have been delayed with substantial changes by Engineer's Instructions. They have also been affected and are affected by ID drawings which are necessary to finalize sprinkler drops before ceiling closures. As these problems clear additional personnel become necessary in order to re-cover delays.

\section{Priority areas}
Priority areas as currently set by the Main Contractor are: Basement~1, Ground Floor, Level~1, Level~2 and Level~7. The covered ceiling area of these priority areas is 35917\sm, representing  91\% of all ceiling areas (see Table \ref{tbl:ceilings}). Besides achieving this target,  Specon will have to make substantial progress in other non-ceiling areas in order to achieve milestones as set in other sections of this report. 




\section{Constraints}\index{Podia! constraints}
\label{sec:podium}
Current resources are inadequate to fully re-cover the delays caused by numerous Engineer's Instructions, late material deliveries and the deployment of Specon technicians to the Towers to assist the sub-contractors. However, once the Tower targets are achieved, personnel currently deployed in Towers can be moved to the Podia to boost production. This should include the re-deployment of sub-contractors technicians and is expected to happen shortly after the 15$^{th}$ of September.

\section{Additional Management}

By end September we expect to substantially reinforce the Management of the \texttt{Podium Areas}, by re-allocating all current Project Managers for the Towers to the Podium Areas. Handover will take place as from the 15$^{th}$ of September. We expect that by that time the Towers will be completed substantially and the remaining final fix activities will not present a problem.

\chapter{Merweb Podia}

\newthought{Although} we did manage to reach a good level of completion, numerous Engineer's Instructions have affected the works in the Merweb Podium areas. An area by area plan is outlined below:

\section{Basement 3}

The Plantroom areas are covered under the sections of the report for systems. The Car parking area is covered by the section on Car Park Ventilation systems.
\section{Basement 2}

Physical completion with the exception of final fix items, CO System. Area needs a plan to be emptied from materials. Shaft works for ducting are incomplete. Car Park Ventilation (Jet fans have been installed, but not 
electrically connected).

\section{Basement 1}

Remaining works relate now to final fix and completion of some electrical boards which are unavailable. These are expected to be delivered on ......

HVAC works have been completed. Sprinkler works are now being finalized (final fix).

\section{Ground Floor}

Remaining works relate to Engineer's Instructions. In addition there are a number of electrical boards that are unavailable. Orders for these have still not been released by HLG.

\section{Level 1}
Remaining works relate to Engineer's Instructions. Most of these instructions are affecting ELV Systems, but are delaying ceiling closures and subsequent final fix activities and commissioning. Note that if ceiling grids are not finalized, it is not possible to complete sprinkler droppers to commission the Fire Protection systems, so even if these EIs are of a minor nature they have a knock-on effect on the system installation.

\end{tabular}

Contract works remaining to be completed are:

\section{Level 2}
As for Level 1
\section{Level 3}
As for Level 1
\section{Level 4}

This level houses the Calorifier and Domestic Plant rooms. The Plant room works, which are covered under the relevant systems are mostly completed physically and are now through the snagging stage. Electrical works have been completed on this floor, inspected and pre-commissioned.

\section{Level 5}

This level houses the ETS Plant rooms, they have been completed, with the exception of snagging items, which are being cleared as manpower permits. Closure of main shafts, is a problem with Black steel duct work, still not completed.

\section{Level 6}

These works have been contracted out to QMMC. A number of EIs have also affected this area. We are unsure of the full impact as some of them have only been received recently. 

\section{Other Areas}

\subsection{Ramps}

Sprinkler and light fittings are still to be installed in ramp areas. Fan-coil units, lights, grilles on staircase installations are still to be completed.
