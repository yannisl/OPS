\newthought{The Standby Generators} can be physically completed before the end of October 2010, subject to all constraints being removed within the first two weeks of August. The generators are all installed, however a substantial amount of work remains to be completed for cabling, panel installation, generators flues etc.

\section{Current Status}

The generators are in place, as well as most of the electrical support installations, such as cable trays and cable ladders. Mechanical pipping works for the Cooling Tower circuits have started. Major work left to carry out includes all Panel installations, completing the Cooling Tower circuits\sidenote{\hl{Considerable progress has been achieved}.}, the generator exhaust piping and the fuel oil system. \sidenote{The fuel oil system has still not be designed, although an EI has been outstanding for more than a year. This is expected to be a three month cycle to approve, procure and install. \hl{Drawings have now been completed and issued to HOK}}

\section{Constraints}

Current constraints are human resources for ductwork installation and certain design issues involving co-ordination. Delivery of MCC panels for electrical hook-up is expected by end of August. Delivery of black steel ducting has started, mock-ups approved by the Engineer. This ductwork is flanged\sidenote{Specification calls for an all-welded construction. HOK has accepted a flanged construction, subject to ductwork pressure testing} and gaskets are still to be approved and procured. \sidenote{These have to be high temperature gaskets}. The ductwork is to be pressure tested. This is expected to slow down construction works. \sidenote{Duct pressure testing equipment are still to be ordered}

None of these constraints are impossible to resolve within a reasonable time. However, unless a full audit of these systems takes place  and we ensure that no redundant re-works are carried out due to co-ordination issues, competion dates can be met. We also expect MEPE to increase the number of personnel working on these systems, once all design, co-ordination and approval issues are resolved at the beginning of August. 

We have not factored the Ramadan slow-down in the key-dates, having assumed that any effect will be compensated by additional overtime in the months of Septemeber and October.

\section{Work Organization}
Due to the importance of these works and the fact that the installation is lagging in progress behind other works a PM\sidenote{This will be requested from Specon UAE} needs to be appointed to be fully responsible for this section of the works.

The work has been subdivided for convenience as follows:

	      \toprule

\section{Sequence for Switch-on}
\normalsize
In order to enable progressive commissioning early switch-on will be targetted. Although it may not be possible to achieve overall switch-on within the time frame envsisaged, sub-systems can be tested earlier on for example, the Cooling Tower circuit, the Chemical Treatment for same and the Fuel system. On the Electrical side, it will only be possible to carry full tests, once a substantial electrical load can be ready for switch-on. However, we expect all cable testing and inspections to be completed by the 30th October.

\section{Management Action Required}
Specon Engineering Manager to ensure that all Design audits are completed and all informational issues finalized, by the first week of August.

HEE to inform Client and HOK that any EIs issued after end of August will only be completed during the period allocated for  after \deadline.
Appointment for an additional Electrical Engineer to act as PM for these plant rooms, is required.

Quick resolution of Commercial Issues to treat all orders for this section of the works as critical. This includes the appointment of an additional sub-contractor (or additional personnel from Specon) for the installation of all exhaust piping.\sidenote{Action taken to correct this. Commercial issues are almost cleared}
