\chapter{Municipal Connections}

Municipal connections for water and drainage are expected to be achieved during the Building Operatonal Permit application period. This is not expected before the \deadline, but at some time after January 2011.

There are no constraints other than that of due process in achieving this earlier. We will make enquiries to the Municipality if meters can be provided earlier, in order to enable the commissioning and testing of the Plumbing System with municipal water and resolve any latent Statutory Authority issues early.
