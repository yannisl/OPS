\newthought{Despite the order having been placed more than a year ago} the Building Management  System is unlikely to be completed on time. Current constraints include the delays in the completion of engineering issues -- due to EIs calling for changes of equipment and modifications in the design --  and the delay in deliveries, primarily DDC panels which are dependent on the detailed engineering being completed.

\section{Current Status}

Control drawings for the majority of the systems have been completed. A schedule of points has gone through a number of revisions and is expected to be finalized and approved by the 7th of August 2010. Detailed Engineering for DDC panels is incomplete and is delaying the manufacture and delivery of the panels. It is also expected that commercial issues will also delay deliveries further, as it does not appear that the original order has covered all the requirements in detail (e.g, Boiler and Calorifier rooms etc.)

Control panels for fan-coil-units have been delivered and these are installed concurrently with fan-coil-units in the Towers.  No work can be completed in Plant-rooms without DDC panels and detailed engineering been completed.

Balance materials have been delivered - but control valves have not. 

\section{Recovery}
Partial recovery can be achieved, by adding resource to the Engineering Team to complete the outstanding drawings and submittlas. If it need be, a subcontractor can be appointed for this.

In order to recover some of the delays a detailed program for all BMS related design needs to be produced and adhered. The  program needs to adopt a strategy to issue information to enable Site installations to progress. If it need be more DDC panels should be utilized, in order to simplify both wiring as well as installation an engineering.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The BMS point schedule needs to be completed.
\item The overall BMS Schematic, showing all DDC panels needs to be completed.
\item The location of all these panels needs to be shown on plans. 
\item Plans for all wiring need to be completed and detailed. At this point Site will be able to start containment and wiring.
\item DDC panels need to be detailed and issued for approval.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Management Action Required}

Management needs to exert pressure to resolve the BMS issues as early as possible.

One electrical engineer to be allocated to follow closure of the BMS on Site.
