\newthought{A substantial portion of the HVAC} Systems are expected to be completed by the \deadline.
The Chilled Water parts of the HVAC Systems as well as some critical ventilation systems are discussed under separate headings. This section discusses the balance of the HVAC Systems especially the AHU Installations and associated ductwork (i.e, the air side of the installations). These systems are currently being installed in a number of  areas and do not render themselves easy to change from an area point of view to a systems approach. 
Delays are expected in the installation of Air Handling Units in Podia due to late deliveries. It is also likely that problems will arise with some of the BCU units and fan-coil-units, as continuing revisions of drawings and EIs may result in additional units.

\ramadaneffect The overtime issue needs to be discussed and agreed with HEE.
\section{Constraints}
\subsection{Engineering and Materials}
For all Towers there are still Air handling Units that have not been delivered\sidenote{Last ones are expected to be delivered in September. However, this Supplier has let us down in the past and some delays are to be expected. Delays are also expected due to the congestion in the Mumbai port due to a shipping accident. Our Procurement Manager has visited the factory in India in order to negotiate improvements in deliveries. }. Various areas still need to be co-ordinated fully. Control valves and BMS DDC panels have still not been delivered and some are still under review by the Design Team and or HOK. These are expected to be delivered late.\sidenote{No illusions that they are going to be completed earlier}

Ductwork deliveries for Towers were and are still problematic. Action has been taken to mitigate these issues by starting a Ductwork Fabrication Workshop on Site, which currently is being resourced to operate in two shifts. However, most of the benefits of the workshop will only be realized once the need for site measured pieces are produced for final fix activities.

Grilles and diffusers for Podia are still to be scheduled and ordered. \sidenote{Expected to be ordered early August.}

\subsection{Labour Resource}

The Site currently does not have an adequate number of Duct Erectors and Duct Fabricators.  (see page \pageref{sec:logistics} for a discussion as to how logistics can help alleviate some of the shortfalls in personnel by increasing productivity.)

We are expecting more Duct Erectors and Fabricators to be sourced from ERE and other Suppliers. We are also investigating outsourcing to more sub-contractors. As some of our own technicians had to return back to Dubai due to visa problems, new visas were requested from HEE and we are now expecting to supplement the work-force with an additional 200 technicians from our UAE resources.

A detailed list of target dates is shown in Tables \ref{tbl:AHUrotana}, \ref{tbl:AHUmerweb} and \ref{tbl:AHUSL} for Rotana, Shangri-la and Merweb respectively. 

We are also in discussions to supplement the Podium workforce with the Tower subcontractors, once the Towers are completed and hence have an increased labour force in September and October.

The fact is that the Podia have suffered as a result of the shifting of our personnel to the Towers to compensate for the failures of the subcontractors.
