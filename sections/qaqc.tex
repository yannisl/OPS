\chapter{Quality Assurance and Quality Control}

Quality cannot be accurately defined, but you know it when you see it. On a Site
Quality is the responsibility of everyone and it generally means that you need to
give attention to details.

\section*{The steps to quality}

There are a number of steps that you need to take in order for your work to
be considered quality work and they are really simple.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Define what you need to do and how to do it. Although the definition part
is simple, it needs to meet the specification, in reality in most cases the specification may be vague. You define the product by making a prototype and by ensuring that it is correct from all angles.

\item Add repeatabiliy

\item Cleanliness

\item Presentation

\end{enumerate}

\section*{The paperwork}

There is a lot of paperwork involved with QA/QC Departments, as a matter of fact perhaps not enough paperwork on a MEP Site as compared to say a manufacturing plant.
