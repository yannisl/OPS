\newthought{The Hotel Towers can be completed by October 30th}\sidenote{Completion meaning, substantial completion and preliminary operation and testing where possible}. Most current problems have mostly been resolved, although there are still issues with ID and EIs.  The Merweb Tower - which always - lagged behind the other Towers continues to do so. This Tower will need a concerted effort and additional personnel to meet the deadline. We have factored this into our completion expectations.

Currently Tower focus is on closing walls and ceilings.

The Tower can be represented by a series of squares, which denote an activity. Green is done and white is not done. There is no need to use intermediate colors. they just detract from the visual information.
