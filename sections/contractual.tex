\chapter{Contractual}

It is important that all Engineers are aware of the original scope of works. The original scope of works can be found here.

Responsibility for raising the issue of V.O.'s is as follows:

\end{figure}


It is a very rare occassion that the person originating the change will
issue an instruction and a variation without us asking for it. However,
small this request is, being professional and recording the change will
ensure that in the event that all these minor variations add up, a propr claim
can be lodged.

\section*{Engineers Instructions}

In order to be able to submit a variation as per our contrcat with ADCC and following common practice an Engineers Instruction or otherwise needs to be issued to us. The ONUS is on us to request it.

Copies of Engineers Instructions are sent to H.O. Attention: Mr Fiaz who will then monitor and ensure that it is submitted.

\section*{Site Responsibility}

To issue adequate backgound information for the Variation Order to be submitted. This shold include the 'narrative' as well as any other back-up documents.


\section*{Issuing}

All documents to flow through document control. All distribution through document control.

\section*{Impact of change orders}

The chart below show the impact of change orders and their distribution. 

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

On Projects where changes are numerous one can produce \textit{measle charts} or
as we call the \textit{chicken pox diagrams}. Like a person afflicted with the
disease your work will be slowed down and the cumulative impact will be much
greater than you think.

\section*{Recording the changes}

Once a Change Order is initiated a number of steps need to be taken
to ensure that contemporaneous records are kept.

The Site QS needs to ensure that a letter is dispatched recording the fact
that the change order will have a time and a cost impact.

The Engineering Manager will need to ensure that the Change Order is reflected
permanently on drawings. The Shop Drawings need to be revised. Please ensure
that revision clouds are included and that the revision text clearly states
the reason for the change.

The Project Manager and Section Engineers will need to assess the impact of
the EI and inform the Commercial Manager of the impact.

The QS will produce weekly and monthly reports as well as record on the
monthly valuations the impact.
