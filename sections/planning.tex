Parts of the HVAC Systems have been discussed under separate headings. This section discusses the balance of the HVAC Systems especially the AHU Installations and associated ductwork. These systems are currently being installed in all areas and do not render themselves easily from a Systems point of view. However, while working in areas all the AHU ducting per AHU will be installed, thus enabling early switch-on of these units once areas served by these units are completed.

\section{Constraints}

\subsection{Engineering and Materials}
Their a number of constraints in completing these systems by the \deadline. For Merweb there are still units that have not been delivered. Various areas still need to be co-ordinated fully. Control valves and BMS DDC panels have still not been delivered and are expected to be delivered late.\sidenote{No illusions that they are going to be completed earlier}

Action has been taken to mitigate these issues by starting a Ductwork Fabrication operation on Site, which currently is moving to two shifts. However, most of the benefits of the workshop will only be realized once Site Measured pieces are produced for final fix activities.

Grilles and diffusers for Podia are still to be scheduled and ordered.

\subsection{Labour Resource}

The Site currently does not have an adequate number of Duct Erectors and fabricators. 

We are expecting more duct erectors and fabricators to be sourced from ERE and other SUppliers. We are also investigating sourcing more sub-contractors.

We expect MEPE to incrase their ductwork installation Team in order to meet the \deadline deadline with all AHU installations already sub-contracted to them.

A detail list of target dates is shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

We also expect our own Team from Rotana to be released into the Podia areas by end of AUgust. To achieve this Tower sub-contractors need to source their own labourers at the earliest.
