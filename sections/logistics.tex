\section{Vertical Transportation}\label{sec:logistics}
With a large work-foce it is essential that Management effort be directed at the movement of people from and to Towers. This is currently severely hampered by the number of available lifts and the Method of controlling them.
\index{Logistics!vertical transportation}

HEE needs to address this issue at the earliest. More lifts are currently available for utilization by KONE and we fail to understand that the benefits of additional lifts is not apparent. 

Specon logistics Team need to be managed properly and this is currently being re-organized.

To achieve targets approximately QR~500~000- QR~700~000 of materials need to be transported and installed daily. This is a major operation in itself. Specon havel re-organized personnel to improve Logistics, which are now headed by Anthony Mooney. 

\section{Stores}
It would have been more efficient to have a one eyed Stores Manager and the right software to control stock, rather having a large group of personnel dedicated to stores that are unable to report on materials properly and consistently. This issue is expected to remain until the end of the Project with all its repercussions.

Removal and control of excess materials from Site is necessary in order to free space and make the re-organization of the Stores easier. Around QR 10-15 million worth of materials left over from Adikaria are expected  not to be used. These need to be sold or stored in a manner than they will not lose their value, preferably in an external store in the Industrial Area. 

The Procurement Team needs to assist the stores to list and indentify these materials at the earliest.
