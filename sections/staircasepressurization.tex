\newthought{The Staircase Pressurization} systems can be completed before the end of October 2010, subject to all constraints being removed within August. We will endeavour to have these systems Tested and Commissioned by the \deadline. Once power is on, within a few days after that we expect to be able to switch these systems on\sidenote{These systems form an integral part of the safety scheme of the buildings.}.

\section{Current Status}

During the wild air operation, these fans were relocated and installed (they are at Level 46 or Level 47), as far as the Towers are concerned with the exception of Merweb most of the vertical ducting has been installed. Once the Main Contractor has made the grilles available and the painting of staircases has been completed, the system can be finalized. MCC Panels have to be delivered and installed. DDC Panels and BMS will need to be finalized, as well as sensor wiring in the Middle floors. All in all there is not much left to complete and these works need to be expedited.

\section{Constraints}

Current constraints are human resources for ductwork installation (especially for Merweb). Delivery of MCC panels for electrical hook-up is expected by end of August. Some of the fans have been exposed to the elements for an extensive period of time (See {\em figure }\ref{fig:rusting} and may need replacement or rectifications). The grilles need to be delivered by maximum end of August and all openings for grilles that need repair must be repaired.
DDC Panels for controls are still to be delivered. All drawings have been approved.

\section{Work Organization}
Due to the importance of these works and the fact that the installation is lagging in progress behind other works a PM\sidenote{This will be requested from Specon UAE} needs to be appointed to be fully responsible for this section of the works.

The work has been subdivided for convenience as follows:
